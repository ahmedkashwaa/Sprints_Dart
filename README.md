# Grocery Cost Calculator

This repository contains a Dart program to calculate the total cost of grocery items, including a 10% tax rate.

## Features
- Calculates the total price of grocery items before tax.
- Adds a fixed tax rate (10%) to the total.
- Outputs the total price before tax, tax amount, and total price after tax.

## Code Structure
- The program uses a list of maps to represent grocery items (`name` and `price`).
- The tax rate is defined as a constant for immutability.
- A loop iterates through the items to compute the total cost.
